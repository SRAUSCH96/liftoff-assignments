## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am making an app that will help you find somewhere to eat when you just cant decide or dont know what is around you.
The app will ask for location, if you are feeling a specific type of food it can categorize by the type. 
You will be able to filter your searches by distance depending how far you want to go. Other filter options like price may be available.
This problem roots from the many times my girlfriend and I cant decide on where to eat.  
My app would be useful for people in need of ideas where to eat.
